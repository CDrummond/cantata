X.X.X
-----
 1. Give tooltips to view actions.
 2. Add 'Set Album Artist from Artist' action to tag editor.
 3. Add option to specify max cover size when transfering to device.
 4. Remove 'Small Control Buttons' option.
 5. Prompt before disconnecting a device.
 6. For playqueue items, if we only have a filename, and no artist, etc, then
    attempt to ascertain artist, album, title, and track number from the
    filename. These will be extracted if the filename has the following pattern:
        "%artist%/%album%/%track% %title%"
    Otherwise, if we cannot extract all of these, just set the title to the
    filename without path.
 7. Allow editing of tags, and replaygain calculation, of files from folder view
    which do not contain tags.
 8. Merge 'External Settings' into 'Interface Settings'
 9. Add option to embed covers when copying songs to devices. (ID3v2, mp4,
    and vorbis comment tag types only) 
10. Add a simple system debus helper to allow user mounts of samba shares. This
    is intended to allow Cantata to connect to an Android device via Droid NAS.
    Requires cantata be built with remote device support (both 
    -DENABLE_REMOTE_DEVICES=ON and -DENABLE_MOUNTER=ON need to be passed to
    cmake).
11. Add first-run wizard to enable basic configuration before Cantata is
    started for the first time.
12. When collapse/expand, only adjust height and not width.
13. Add a 'Cache' page to settngs dialog, allowing cahce usage to be displayed
    and cache items delete.
14. Move group warning to last stage of intial settings wizard.
15. Basic cover fetching dialog, allowing to change downloaded cover. Curerntly
    Last.fm and Google are used to find images.
16. Use cache by default for devices.
17. Compress cache files.
18. Save remote device library settings on remote device.
19. When using list or icon view, only show genres that are relevant to the
    current level.
20. (Qt-Only) When displaying filesizes, use KiB (1024 bytes) for KDE and
    Windows, and kB (1000 bytes) for others.
21. Recolour repeat and shuffle icons to use button text colour - this is so
    that they always match consume and single icons.
22. Re-enable animation when showing messagewidget, for Qt-only builds and
    for non 4.9.4 KDE builds.
23. Slightly speed up playqueue searches.
24. Add prompt before removing playlists.
25. When dropping files onto playqueue, check that they have a recognized
    extension (mp3, ogg, flac, wma, m4a, m4b, mp4, m4p, wav, wv, wvp, aiff,
    aif, aifc, ape, spx, tta, mpc, mpp, mp+, dff, dsf)
26. Add import of IceCast and SomaFM streams.
27. Move server info into a dialog.
28. Add support for Jamendo and Magnatune streams.
29. Add 'Add Stream' button to play queue - so that streams can be quickly
    added without needing to store in streams page.
30. For streams, use filename part of path as track title.
31. Fix setting of buttons in song copy dialog (Qt-only builds, KDE already
    working).
32. Only stop dynamizer on exit if option enabled, not if just stop playback on
    exit is enabled.
33. Add a new view style - 'Detailed Tree'. This uses the list-style appearance
    for treeviews - e.g. The album count appears under each artist, etc.

0.9.2
-----
 1. (Qt-Only) Dont show clear button for read-only line-edits.
 2. Fix 'Locate In Library' when library is not set to tree mode.
 3. Use grid layout for transcoder slider, removes Qt layout warning.
 4. Simplified Chinese translation - thanks to 薛景
 5. Fix restoring of splitter sizes when we start minimized to system tray.
 6. Fix decoding of Cantata HTTP stream URLs.
 7. Work-around issue of non display of main window when using transparent
    QtCurve theme.
 8. Fix playing of some non-MP3 files external to MPD database via Cantata's
    simple HTTP server.
 9. Fix playing of files containing square brackets, etc, that are external
    to MPD database via Cantata's simple HTTP server.
10. Fix detection of some filetypes.
11. Prevent multiple KDE Cantata windows appearing if app is attempted to be
    started repeatedly in quick succession.
12. For streams, if we have a 'name' but no artist or album title, then just
    display the name (this is usually the Radio Station)
13. For a song to be 'empty', artist, album, title, and name need to be empty.
    This fixes detection of updates to the name field when playing streams.
14. Fix potential memory leak when stopping threads.
15. Only enable play queue save-as and clear buttons if there are items in the
    play queue!
16. Fix detection of streams in play queue when current song is updated.

0.9.1
-----
1. Fix saving of 'Store covers in MPD dir' setting.
2. Show/hide main window when KDE tray item clicked.
3. Add 'Show Window' to tray item menu.
4. Dont allow to set focus onto clear button in line-edits.
5. Remove animation when showing messagewidget, seems to workaround a crash
   when compiled with KDE and using Oxygen.
6. Fix activation of devices tab via keyboard shortcut.

0.9.0
-----
 1. Add a 'server' mode to cantata-dynamic. This contains a basic HTTP API to
    list rules, update rules, and start/stop the dynamic mode.
 2. Allow use of 'dynamic' playlists in windows builds, but only for server mode
    cantata-dynamic.
 3. Add support for 'Similar Artists' in dynamic mode.
 4. Add a gui setting to control the enforcement of single-click.
 5. When sorting tracks, sort on duration after sorting on name, title, and
    genre. This way if tracks do not have a track number, disc, year, etc, then
    we will sort on the name/title before duration.
 6. When refreshing DB, make sure Albums view is at top level.
 7. Set Artist, AlbumArtist, and Album of cue files to that of assigned album.
 8. Improve item-view mouse over for Gtk+ style - when hovering, draw selection
    into a QPixmap and set painter's opacity before drawing image.
 9. Workaround issue of sometimes having an item (in icon view) staying in
    mouse-over state, even though mouse has left view.
10. For Qt translations, provide two strings for plural translation. One for
    singular (e.g. "1 Track") and one for plural (e.g. "%1 Tracks"). For
    languages that have more than 1 plural form, it is suggested that BOTH
    strings are translatated to the format "Items: %1" - e.g. "1 Track" becomes
    "Tracks: 1", and "%1 Tracks" becomes "Tracks: %1"
11. Device sync support for Qt-only  builds. To support this, a cut-down version
    of Solid is included.
12. Don't enforce oxygen icons for Qt-only (Linux) builds. Check for missing
    icons, and use alternatives.
13. Use a random icon that matches the repeat icon better.
14. Draw the consume icon in code, so that it matches random and repeat better.
15. Add a ON/OFF style checkbox for linux builds when NOT run under KDE, and
    using QGtkStyle.
16. Add a custom spinbox to closer match Gtk3's large button spinbox style.
    Only for linux builds NOT run under KDE, and using QGtkStyle.
17. Add 'Show Window' action to Linux builds - so that we have a way of
    restoring the Cantata window from the Unity menubar.
18. Use freedesktop.org notifications for Qt-only Linux builds.
19. Show menubar when run under Unity (Qt-only build).
20. Improve MPRISv2 interface - signal when proprties change.
21. Play/Pause track when middle click on tray icon for Qt-only builds (KDE
    builds already have this). Thanks to spartanj for the patch.
22. Remove faded icons from background of sync dialog views (as these did not
    render correctly with all styles), and enforce alternate row colours - as
    per other views.
23. Fix image/icon size, and spacing issues, in sync dialog when the library
    view is set to use icon/list style.
24. Add 'Add To Playlist' action to playqueue context menu.
25. Fix retrieval of covers from file-system based devices.
26. Support for modifiable keyboard shortcuts in Qt-only builds. (Code stolen
    from Quassel!)
27. Add option to control whether Cantata should minimise to the notification
    area when closed (default), or terminate.
28. Only save settings when modified.
29. Add option to support GNOME media keys.
30. Add setting to control name (without extension) of downloaded cover files.
31. For KDE builds, if run under Unity set KStatusNotifierItem status to
    Active - otherwise no item appears.
32. Truncate error messages to 150 characters. Set message (up to 500
    characters) as tooltip of message widget.
33. Remove setting of dockmanager item to current cover. This is better handled
    by an external dockmanager helper script, as per amarok, etc.
34. Remove option to enable/disable MPRIS interface, and always have enabled.
35. Disable Phonon stream playback support by default. Currently not all
    Phonon backends seem to work reliably, and there can be delays between
    pressing a button (e.g. start) and the action occuring (due to buffering?).
    To re-enable pass -DENABLE_PHONON=ON to cmake.
36. Handle UTF-8 playlist names.
37. Sort selected playqueue indexes before adding to stored playlist.
38. Update 'Add To Playlist' menu when rename a playlist.
39. Only need to download/parse streams (to check if they are a playlist) when
    added from the streams page. (Streams in an MPD playlist will not be
    playlists themselves, as MPD does not support this.)
40. Allow building of replaygain support with either ffmpeg or mpg123, or both.
41. Display extra information texts in messageboxs and not whats-this popups,
    as QGtkStyle seems to have issues with the palette in these.
42. Fix dynamic playlists with UTF-8 strings.
43. Remove unreferenced library cache's each time connection details are saved.
44. When KDE version is closed via quit action, ensure main window destructor
    is called - so that settings are saved.
45. Compile windows build against taglib 1.8 - enables tag editing and track
    reorganisation.
46. Korean translation - thanks to Min Ho Park.
47. Fix detection of audio codecs for ffmpeg 1.0.
48. Remove libmaia usage.
49. For Linux Qt builds, use dbus to determine single app status.
50. Add connect/disconnect functionality for UMS devices.
51. Fix crash when calling QFileDialog in Qt-only builds when Oxygen or QtCurve
    themes are used.
52. In devices view, only show covers that come from device.
53. Remove folders, albums, and cover art, when deleting tracks from MTP
    devices.
54. Copy covers from MTP devices. (Copying to the device is not currently
    supported.)
55. Show track listing progress when loading MTP devices.
56. For Qt-only Linux builds, check if current icon theme has the
    "document-save-as" icon. If not, then if the user has ether oxugen or gnome
    icon theme installed - set the icon theme name to this.
57. For Qt-only builds, allow to configure the icon theme name via Cantata's
    config file (~/.config/cantata/cantata.conf on Linux). Edit file and add
    (e.g.) the following in the "[General]" section:

        iconTheme=oxygen

    ...there is no GUI for this, as its only a work-around for some window
    managers.
58. If group single tracks, or multiple artists, settings are changed, then
    rebuild library and device models from existing set of songs - as opposed
    to re-reading all songs from mpd/device.
59. If window is minimized to system tray when Cantata is terminated, then
    restore to this state when restarted.
60. Add search line-edits, and expand/collapse all, to sync dialog.
61. Add a 1 pixel border around large cover in top-left corner.
62. When refresh button is pressed send an update and stats request to MPD.
63. Hard-code black background and gray text for cover widget tooltip.
64. Ignore quit action if we have open dialogs.
65. Fix crash when copying items to devices after a rescan has been performed.
66. Use UPower (Linux/Qt) to detect when being resumed, and if so reconnect to
    MPD.
67. In sync dialog, when detecting items unique to library/device, revert
    various artist work-around for each track if it is enabled on the device.
68. Fix memleak when copying items to/from devices.
69. When creating temp files, ensure these are in /tmp!
70. If applying various artist workaround for a remote device, apply the
    workaround to a local temp file, and send this.

0.8.3.1
-------
1. Fix Qt-only compile.

0.8.3
-----
 1. Add CMake options to disable 'automagic' dependencies - required for gentoo
    USE flags (http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/qa/automagic.xml). Because of this
    WANT_KDE_SUPPORT option has been renamed to ENABLE_KDE
 2. When requesting covers from a HTTP server, use QUrl::toPercentEncoding.
 3. Fix multiple download attempts when getting covers from HTTP.
 4. With KDE builds (4.7 or later), and Windows Qt builds, reconnect to MPD when
    system is resumed. (A reconnect attempt is made every half second for a max
    of 15 seconds)
 5. To help with windows build, embed pre-rendered versions of main icon.
 6. When restoring window from notification area, also raise and activate the
    window.
 7. Fix issue with certain styles not drawing selection background in icon view.
 8. If we show an error, or info, message whilst using compact interface - then
    adjust size to take message widget into account.
 9. If we lose MPD connection, then show error widget.
10. Reset status when connection lost.
11. Don't attempt to send commands if not connected.
12. In Qt-builds, if we fail to update files (tag editor, replaygain) then
    show the list of failures in the 'detailed text' section.
13. In Qt (Linux) build, also register org.kde.cantata service - so that
    messages from dynamic helper can be received.
14. Update version of KMessageWidget
15. Update Polish translation.
16. Use 'avcodec' if 'ffmpeg' is not found.
17. Show current song details in tooltip of notification icon for Qt builds as
    per KDE builds.
18. If 'showPage' is called (via DBUS interface), ensure interface is expanded.
19. Save MPD filename scheme settings with MPD server settings.
20. Use QWIDGETSIZE_MAX and not INT_MAX to set maximum height of expanded
    interface.
21. More consistent control of prev/next buttons.
22. Allow 'showPage' dbus command to also show playqueue (if this has been
    placed in the sidebar)
23. Fix handling of filename's with quotes.
24. Fix track order when adding newly added album, via folders page, to
    playqueue.
25. Don't split albums based upon year - this messes up compilation albums,
    where each track may have a different year.
26. To be consistent, use the year of the lowest track number to be an album's
    year.
27. Use "users" group and not "audio" when setting the group ID of covers,
    lyrics, and audio files.
28. If we have no song tag details, show filename in playqueue.
29. In KDE builds, check if MPD is readable each time we get a device added
    or removed signal from Solid if using KDE4.9. If we are using an older KDE,
    or using Qt-only (on Linux) then watch for changes to /proc/mounts
30. If the date string received from MPD is longer than 4 characters, just use
    the first 4 - as we are only interested in the year.
31. If not changing artist/albumartist/album of a track in tag editor, then
    just update track if possible - as opposed to removing and adding to list
    (which causes a complete refresh of list)
32. When displaying cover tooltip, if image is too big or image file is not
    found (as is the case for embedded covers), then save the image into a
    base64 array as a PNG - and have Qt use this in the 'img' tag.
33. Package Qt's jpeg image plugin with windows zip file - otherwise jpeg
    cover images cannot be loaded!
34. Package missing edit-clear-locationbar-rtl.png icons so that clear button
    appears in windows line-edits.
35. Use correct palette (Active/Inactive) when drawing item text.
36. Force single-click activation in views. To enable double-click mode (which
    depends upon the style), edit cantatarc (KDE) or cantata.conf (Qt only) and
    set 'forceSingleClick=false' in the '[General]' section.
37. When looking for album covers, also check for "${file}.jpg/png",
    "${albumArtist} - ${album}.jpg/png" and "${album}.jpg/png" within current
    songs folder. (These are checked AFTER cover.jpg/png, etc.)
38. Improve FancyTabWidget appearance for Gtk+ style - when hovering, draw
    selection into a QPixmap and set painter's opacity before drawing image.
39. Elide to right (or left for RTL) strings in sidebar.
40. Implement support for translations in Qt-only builds. These use the KDE
    translations. Plural forms not supported correctly, hence instead of
    "1 Track" / "2 Tracks" Qt will have "Tracks: 1" / "Tracks: 2" The existing
    translations will need to be updated to handle the Qt specific cases.
41. Dont clear genre list when clearing music library model.
42. If we are grouping multiple-artists albums under 'Various Artists', then
    we also need to place 'Various Artists' albums there as well. This oddity
    can occur when i18n('Various Artists') != 'Various Artists'
43. Add 'Back' action to context menu of list/icon views.

0.8.2
-----
1. Fix track order when adding newly added album to playqueue.
2. When dragging one artist, or album, in treeview to play queue, show cover
   image (if possible).
3. Fix crash when toggling playqueue in sidebar at application start-up.

0.8.1
-----
 1. Detect when this is the first time a user has run Cantata. If so, don't
    place the play queue in the sidebar.
 2. Don't attempt to rename a playlist to its current name - otherwise it is
    deleted!
 3. When applying updates in tag editor, track organizer, or replay gain dialog
    show a progress bar to indicate activity.
 4. Display version number in Qt-only about dialog.
 5. When expanding interface, set max size to INT_MAX. Otherwise, on windows at
    least, the maximise button can get disabled.
 6. If 'Music folder' in settings dialog is a http folder (path starts with
    http://), then attempt to download cover-art from the http server.
 7. Don't update MPD volume just after we receive a status update - as MPD
    already has that setting! Fixes an issue with pulseaudio setups - where MPD
    disconnects from pulse audio, tells cantata that volume is -1, and cantata
    attempts to set volume to 0.
 8. When fading on stop, reset original volume immediately before sending stop.
 9. Fix saving of library to XML cache when multiple artist albums are grouped
    under 'Various Artists' (only save artist attribute once!!)
10. Use command list when adding songs to playlist.

0.8.0
-----
 1. Add ability to play MPD HTTP output stream via phonon. Thanks to Marcel
    Bosling for the idea and initial patch.
 2. Implement Ctrl+MouseWheel zoom for Qt-only info view.
 3. Initial attempt at a Windows port. (This is my 1st EVER windows build, so
    don't expect much!). See README.
 4. Add Track Organizer dialog to Qt-only build.
 5. Disable 'Edit Tags' and 'Organize Files' actions if MPD dir is not readable.
 6. No need to check if playqueue song exists in MPD dir when performing a
    'locate in library'. Its possible that the configured MPD dir does not
    exist - but 'locate in library' should still work.
 7. Implement a basic spinner widget for item views in Qt-only builds.
 8. Make Qt-only builds single instance apps, as per KDE build.
 9. Add commandline file loading support to Qt-only builds.
10. Remove ThreadWeaver usage, and add ReplayGain calculation support to
    Qt-only builds.
11. Fix size of playback buttons in qt-only build. Force icons to have a
    28x28 setting.
12. Add support for listing playlist files in folder view. Thanks to Aleksandr
    Beliaev for the patch.
13. When adding items to the playqueue, sort the selected items based upon
    their QModelIndex.
14. Add support for multiple MPD servers. Only 1 is ever active. If there
    are 2 or more servers defined, the settings menu will contain a sub menu
    to allow quick access to each server.
15. If an MPD connection has more than 1 output, show an 'Outputs' sub menu
    in the settings menu.
16. Disable volume control if MPD returns a volume of -1 - as it does when the
    mixer is disabled.
17. Read images from mp3 (ID3v2), mp4, flac, and ogg files.
18. Read lyrics from mp3 (ID3v2) files.
19. Fix genre filtering in albums view - filter was not updated when genre was
    changed.
20. Fix background painting in lyrics view for non-oxygen styles.
21. Enable mouse-tracking for all list/tree views.
22. Allow Icon/List for library view.
23. Add option to show artist images in library view.
24. Don't allow selection to overlap tab-widget border-lines in preferences
    dialog (Qt-only build).
25. Show playlists in library and album views (requires MPD 0.17)
26. Update ultimate_providers.xml to match Clementine 1.0.1
27. When clicking on a label associated with a combobox, show the combo popup.
28. Fix spacing issues of compact interface with some styles. If the style
    (such as the Qt Gtk style) returns -1 for its spacing, assume a spacing of
    4 pixels instead.
29. Workaround tab-widget issues with Gtk style. Only draw highlight for
    selected item, and item currently under mouse - no fade in/out.
30. Fix/workaround issues with fetching lyrics from letras.mus.br
31. Add option to specify HTTP server listen address/interface.
32. Support MPD queue functionality. Add an 'Add With Priority' to menu of
    library, etc, views. Add a 'Set Priority' to play queue. Requires MPD
    0.17.0 or newer.
33. Only ignore closeEvent if this is a 'spontaneous' event and we have a tray
    icon.
34. Drastically reduce replay-gain calculation memory usage.
35. Make more columns italic in replaygain dialog to make entries that will be
    modified.
36. Make TagLib optional.
37. Adjust size of covers in grouped view, icons in views, and main cover
    preview based upon font size.
38. Add an extra cover-size setting (Automatic) which will adjust the covers in
    library and albums view based upon font size.
39. Add option to place playqueue in sidebar.
40. Add keyboard short-cut for 'back' icon in listviews.
41. Fix issue (in Qt-builds) where message widget sometimes (mainly at start-up)
    is not not as wide as the main window.
42. Provide sub-text for all items in folderview, fixes corruption of list
    mode.
43. Add option to have sidebar on the sides, top, or bottom.
44. Only show number of tracks, and duration, in playqueue status - consistent
    with other players.
45. Fix compile with avcodec v54
46. If KWallet is disabled, store password in config file.
47. When fetching lyrics or info for a song which has had the 'various artists'
    workaround applied - revert this before requesting data.
48. When reading mpd.conf file, if bind_to_address is set to "any", then use
    default of "localhost".
49. Fix noticing of tag changes when MPD database is updated. When comparing
    songs need to check all fields - not just filename!
50. Fix usage of tekstowo.pl and vagalume.com.br in lyrics settings.
51. Stop position timer whilst dragging slider.

0.7.1
-----
1. When saving track name to cache, save the actual name, not the displayed
   name.
2. Attempt to fix errors in cache where the displayed name was saved.
3. Fix tag-editor's 'Various Artists' workaround when all tracks is selected.
4. Set minimum font size for info page.
5. Only automatically start playing songs if we are replacing the playqueue, or
   the song is the first song added via the commandline.
6. Fix transcoding with new ffmpeg - thanks to Martin Blumenstingl for the
   patch.
7. Have cantata-dynamic helper script send a dbus message when it starts and
   stops - so that cantata main window can show the current status if the helper
   is started externally.
8. If 'Return'/'Enter' is pressed when play queue has focus, start playing from
   the first selected song.
9. Fix Qt-only install failure (cannot find RUNTIME).

0.7.0
-----
 1. Add dynamic playlist support.
 2. Fix detection of non standard filename covers.
 3. Clear any existing search when 'Locate In Library' is activated.
 4. In tag-editor, only set placeholder text to '(Various)' for fields where
    there are actually some values set.
 5. Add now playing info to MPRIS interface - thanks to Martin Blumenstingl
    for the patch.
 6. Better, less hacky, workaround for QAbstractItemView shift-select bug
    (https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-18009). Thanks to Spitfire
    from qtcentre.org forums for fix.
 7. Add a 'search' action (Ctrl-F) that will move focus to curent tab's search
    field - or to play queue search field (if play queue has focus).
 8. Add 'Raise' support to MPRIS interface.
 9. Added a cantata-specific dbus interface with 'showPage(page, focusSearch)'
    method. So, to raise cantata, show library page, and focus on its search
    field:
        qdbus org.kde.cantata /org/mpris/MediaPlayer2 Raise
        qdbus org.kde.cantata /cantata showPage library true

    'page' can be either; library, albums, folders, playlists, dynamic, streams,
    lyrics, info, serverinfo, or devices. The page will only be shown if it is
    currently enabled.
10. Show song information in playqueue tooltips.
11. Default to 'Alt+<num>' for page shortcuts.
12. Improve MPD connection reliability. When one socket (command or idle) is
    disconnected, only reconnect that one. If a reconnect fails, then
    disconnect both. If we receive an empty reply to a command and socket has
    been closed - then attempt to reconnect and resend command.
13. Request list of URL handlers immediately after connecting.
14. Check if user is a member of 'audio' group at start-up, and warn if they
    are not. If a user is a member of 'audio', then cantata will save covers,
    lyrics, imported songs, etc, as writeable by 'audio'
15. Attempt to read defaults from /etc/mpd.conf (This is usually readable by
    'audio' group)
16. If connection fails due to password, then state this in error message.
17. Add extra-large  cover sizes (64pixels library, 160pixels albums).
18. Show full size cover image in tooltip for current track cover preview
    widget.
19. Update copy of ebur128
20. Fix fetching of covers for grouped playlists.
21. For sshfs devices; check ksshaskpass is installed, and check that cantata
    was not launched from the commandline (otherwise ksshaskpass is not
    invoked!)
22. Add option for UMS devices to autoscan, or not, when detected - default is
    set to not autoscan.
23. Fix detection of some UMS devices that are already mounted at startup.
24. Load library view covers in separate thread, as per albums view.
25. Add expandAll (Ctrl +) / collpseAll (Ctrl -) actions to expand/collapse all
    items of currently    focused treeview.
26. Emit dataChanged() for all album header items that match the album
    currently being expanded/collpased in the groupedview.
27. Add a basic 'sync' dialog. Shows two lists; left has songs that are only in
    library, right has songs that are only on device. Each has a 'Copy to'
    action. When songs are copied, the lists are updated to show the remaining
    differences.
28. Fix albums view position when going back from album contents.
29. Add option to draw (15% opacity) tiled cover as background to lyrics page.
30. When clicking on a label, pass focus to buddy widget. If this buddy is a
    checkbox, then also toggle its state.
31. When grouping songs into albums, take into account song year. Its possible
    for an artist to release two albums with the same name in different years!
32. Remove 'Single Tracks' cover creation. This is not used in grouped view,
    etc.
33. Limit downloaded covers to a max of 600x600 pixels.
34. Don't update 'current song' details when playqueue is updated - the current
    song is updated by other means. As we now use 'plchangesposid' to speed
    updates, we dont always have the full song info when playqueue is updated.
    This fixes a bug where the cover widget sometimes gets reset to empty.
35. When updating a non-MTP device, prompt the user as to whether to perform
    a partial scan (only new songs are scanned), or a full scan (where all songs
    are rescanned).
36. When creating/editing a SSHFS remote device, allow user to use
    KDirRequester to select music folder. (KDirRequester is passed an sftp://
    url to obtin folder listing).
37. When refreshing lyrics, instead of starting at first provider and iterating
    them all again (which will result in the same hit again), start at the next
    provider. This allows all providers to be checked. Thanks to Martin
    Blumenstingl for the patch.
38. Fix copying track from MTP devices.
39. When performing a custom lyrics search, and we have no current song, dont
    attempt to save the file to MPDs music folder (there is no valid filename).
40. When adding items to playqueue, only start to play if playqueue was
    previously empty.
41. When determining indexes to add to 'selectedIndexes' for a collapsed album
    (in grouped style play queue/lists), ensure each index is only added once.
42. Fix loading of songs via commandline if we are set to use HTTP server.

10. If fading out to stop, and cantata is closed, then send stop command.
11. Add 'Edit Song Tags' action to playqueue context menu.

32. Fix crash in albums model when library updated after albums removed.
33. Fix filetype resolver so that we dont attempt to read tags from video files
    (asf/wmv/mp4v) - these seem to crash TagLib.
