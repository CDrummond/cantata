- Qt5 port
  - After KDE Frameworks 5 is released, add CMake option to use system Solid
    libraries.

- Windows port
  - CMake scripts not working
  - Build QtNetwork with SSL support? libeay32.dll and libssl32.dll will also
    need to be supplied with installer.
  - Port to Qt5. With Qt5.2 use QWinThumbnailToolButton 

- Streams
  - If radio stream is a playlist, Cantata currently only uses the 1st entry.
    Perhaps Cantata should loop over all entries until we find one that plays?
  - last.fm streams?

- Online services
  - GPodder support?
  - DAAP servers?
  - Subsonic servers? Mopidy can be used to access SubSonic.

- Devices
  - libMTP does not support album artist tag. Cantata contains some
    work-arounds for this (such as guessing the album-artist tag via the folder
    structure, etc). These should be removed if libMTP ever supports album
    artist.
  - Port to MTP DBus service when this is released.
  - RemoteFsDevices
    - Cantata hangs if smb service is stopped before its un-mounted
  - Re-enable covers in sync dialog?
  - CD-Text?
  - Fix time-remaining calculation in action dialog.
  - Seek support for AudioCDs. Initial implementation works sometimes, but
    other times the song is re-started. Not in build due to being too flaky.
  - Possible issues with UDisks2, might not be able to get block device
    (e.g. /dev/sr0)?
  - Playback from MTP devices.

- Mopdiy
  - Currently does not send valid DB date time (always 0). Users will need to
    force Cantata to update.
  - Does not support 'update' command
  - If the response of a stats call is all 0, then we assume the connection is
    to a Mopdiy server. Therefore, when adding files (from devices) these are
    encoded.

- Lyrics
  - Add support for reading via tags in mp4 files.

- PlayQueue
  - Move code out of MainWindow class.

- General
  - Ratings (use KRatingWidget?)
    - Not sure, would need support in cantata-dynamic
    - MPD's 'stickers' could be used, but there is no way to query tag+value
      you can only query for tracks that have tag. So, could query for all
      tracks with tag=rating, but not tag=rating and value=4
  - mixramp tag calculation
  - mixramp MPD settings
    - Does MPD need to be restarted to change settings?

- Bugs
  - Jamendo search sometimes causes crash (not seen for a while)
  - Handle font (High DPI detection) and palette changes in custom widgets
    (Volume control, time slider, etc)
