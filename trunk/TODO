...high priority...


Cover Manager
   - Need way to fetch covers
   - Copy amarok code?
   - Have manual button


...medium priority...

Proxy support for Qt (read system settings, and also add config page)

Fix usage of threads - ideally writing/reading should be in thread object.

Need better repeat icon.

Cover fetcher - google, amazon, save to server dir? Read from sever dir? Add to right-click menu "Fetch cover"

Support streams - for radio!
   Will probably need to store mapping from URL to name, so that can show this in title.
   How does MPD store this - it doesnt! Could probably save as a playlist with 1 entry?



...low priority...

When starting, config dialog is shown (because MP not started, etc) then show some text exlplaining this!

Add config of MPD itself -> requires KAuth???
   outputs
   album artist support

Fix Qt-only build, disable in CMakeLists.txt as its broken!!!
