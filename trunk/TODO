   Need to
        connect(MPDConnection::....
        QThread *mpdThread = new QThread(this);
        MPDConnection::self()->moveToThread(mpdThread);
        mpdThread->start();

        emit startMpd();

Support streams - for radio!
   Will probably need to store mapping from URL to name, so that can show this in title.
   How does MPD store this - it doesnt! Could probably save as a playlist with 1 entry?
