  - libMTP album artist usage.
    - libMTP does not provide an album artist tag.
    - song.cpp has a check to see if this.albumartist=other.album artist, so
      that when library is frefreshed the file is in the correct place.
    - mtpdevice.cpp will remove albumartist from 'Song' entries copied to it,
      so that these are placed in the correct part of the model.
    - If libMPT is 'fixed' then the above can be removed.
  - Make Various 'Artists' fix applicable to all compilation albums?
    - Not sure how this could be done with MTP :-(
    - MTP has no access to other tags, so when converting back, how would I
      know this is a compilation?
  - Allow to drag songs from albums/library to devices, and vice versa.
  - Detect AudioCDs
    - call audex/kaudiocoverter/soundKonverter/k3b?
    - or list via audiocd:// ???

- PlayQueue
  - Add copy to device to context menu?
    - Will need to be careful that songs are not from device
    - Also, check that songs are not streams!
  - Tabbed mode, to show other play lists?

  - Ratings (use KRatingWidget?)
  - mpdscribble management?
