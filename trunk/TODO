* Playlists
    - Lazy loading of playlist contents - current is not 100%, but is ok if we want genre filtering
    - Add genre filtering

* Streams
    - allow drag'n'drop within categories
    - add genre support?
    - will need to place some items in a menu.
    - Perhaps import/export/edit could go into a 'Tools' menu
    - Handle xspf/spiff playlists
    - Handle more than 1st entry?? Not sure
    - Check that MPD can handle protocols before adding
    - Display list of schemas in 'Info' page

* Library page
    - show Various Artists at top, with custom icon?
    - Have artist icons ?

* Add next/prev provider buttons to lyrics page - so that can try others.

* Need better repeat icon.

* Sidebar
   - Allow to collapse current item

* When displaying search results, should expand items to show matched entry

* Use KMessageWidget to display errors?
