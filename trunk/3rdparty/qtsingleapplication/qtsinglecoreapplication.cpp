    \class QtSingleCoreApplication qtsinglecoreapplication.h
    \brief A variant of the QtSingleApplication class for non-GUI applications.

    This class is a variant of QtSingleApplication suited for use in
    console (non-GUI) applications. It is an extension of
    QCoreApplication (instead of QApplication). It does not require
    the QtGui library.

    The API and usage is identical to QtSingleApplication, except that
    functions relating to the "activation window" are not present, for
    obvious reasons. Please refer to the QtSingleApplication
    documentation for explanation of the usage.

    A QtSingleCoreApplication instance can communicate to a
    QtSingleApplication instance if they share the same application
    id. Hence, this class can be used to create a light-weight
    command-line tool that sends commands to a GUI application.

    will be QCoreApplication::applicationFilePath(). \a argc and \a
