- Qt5 port
  - Fix raising of mainwindow via dbus. (Qt5 no longer has QX11Info)

- Windows port
  - CMake scripts not working

- Streams
  - If radio stream is a playlist, Cantata currently only uses the 1st entry.
    Perhaps Cantata should loop over all entries until we find one that plays?

- Devices
  - libMTP does not support album artist tag.
  - Port to MTP DBus service when this is released.
  - Allow to drag songs from albums/library to devices, and vice versa.
  - RemoteFsDevices
    - Cantata hangs if smb service is stopped before its un-mounted
  - Re-enable covers in sync dialog?
  - CD-Text?
  - Fix time-remaining calculation in action dialog.
  - Seek support for AudioCDs. Might be due to sending data as WAV
    - MPD seems to send 1 seek to skip 44 bytes, then actual seek
  - Possible issues wth UDisks2, might not be able to get block device
    (e.g. /dev/sr0)?
  - Playback from MTP devices.

- Lyrics
  - Add support for reading via tags in mp4, flac, and ogg files.

- PlayQueue
  - Move code out of MainWindow class.
  - Add copy to device to context menu?
    - Will need to be careful that songs are not from device
    - Also, check that songs are not streams!

- Cue files
  - How to (reliably) determine duration of last track?

- MPD Stream playback
  - Playback functionality needs to handle URL change when connection changes.

- General
  - Ratings (use KRatingWidget?)
    - Not sure, would need support in cantata-dynamic
  - mpdscribble management
  - mixramp tag calculation
  - mixramp MPD settings
  - Create a base 'Page' class?
