- Qt5 port
  - Fix raising of mainwindow via dbus. (Qt5 no longer has QX11Info)
  - Qt 5.2's QLineEdit has clearbutton functionality. If compiled against Qt5.2
    then Cantata should use native QLineEdit.
  - After KDE Frameworks 5 is released, add CMake option to use system Solid
    libraries.

- Windows port
  - CMake scripts not working
  - Build QtNetwork with SSL support? libeay32.dll and libssl32.dll will also
    need to be supplied with instaler.
  - Port to Qt5. With Qt5.2 use QWinThumbnailToolButton 

- MacOS port
  - Initial work imported into 1.2.0, however no builds we ever released. No
    idea if this still compiles or not!
 
- Streams
  - If radio stream is a playlist, Cantata currently only uses the 1st entry.
    Perhaps Cantata should loop over all entries until we find one that plays?
  - last.fm streams?
  - Move service json/xml response parsing into perl helper scripts?

- Online services
  - GPodder support?
  - DAPP servers?
  - Subsonic server?

- Devices
  - libMTP does not support album artist tag. Cantata contains some
    work-arounds for this (such as guessing the album-artist tag via the folder
    structure, etc). These should be removed if libMTP ever supports album
    artist.
  - Port to MTP DBus service when this is released.
  - RemoteFsDevices
    - Cantata hangs if smb service is stopped before its un-mounted
  - Re-enable covers in sync dialog?
  - CD-Text?
  - Fix time-remaining calculation in action dialog.
  - Seek support for AudioCDs. Initial implementation works sometimes, but
    other times the song is re-started. Not in build due to beeing too flakey.
  - Possible issues wth UDisks2, might not be able to get block device
    (e.g. /dev/sr0)?
  - Playback from MTP devices.

- Lyrics
  - Add support for reading via tags in mp4, flac, and ogg files.

- PlayQueue
  - Move code out of MainWindow class.
  - Add copy to device to context menu?
    - Will need to be careful that songs are not from device
    - Also, check that songs are not streams!
  - When adding songs to playqueue, if a filter is active (genre, or text) then
    we should only add songs that pass the filter
    - Affects; Artists, Albums, Folders (text only), Playlists, Online, Devices,
      Streams (text only)
    - Would need to put the device/artist/album expansion code within proxy
      models
      - then we call filenames()/songs() on the proxy.
    - NOT 100% sure. - as the items show #tracks, etc. If we are only going to
      add so many tracks then this would also need to be updated. (As well as
      tooltips). Again, this would need to be in the proxy model.

- Cue files
  - How to (reliably) determine duration of last track?

- MPD Stream playback
  - Playback functionality needs to handle URL change when connection changes.

- General
  - Ratings (use KRatingWidget?)
    - Not sure, would need support in cantata-dynamic
  - mpdscribble management
  - mixramp tag calculation
  - mixramp MPD settings
    - Does MPD need to be restarted to change settings?
  - Create a base 'Page' class?
  - Reduce memory usage - use QCache for artists and albums models?

- Bugs
  - Jamendo search sometimes causes crash (not seen for a while)
  - Handle font (High DPI detection) and palette changes in custom widgets
    (Volume control, time slider, etc)
