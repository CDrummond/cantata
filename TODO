Fix Qt only build
   DirSelect widget - need to make custom, with lineedit and button.


Covers
   Rename Cover to CoverCache
   Disable library updates when cover manager is open
   Cover fetch dialog
       Fetching cover for: <album> by <artist>
       "Configure..." should just have currently selected provider


Code organisation:
    lib -> mpd
    create a 'models'  dir to hold libray and dir models
    Move genre stuff fro main window into librarypage class
    Remove aboutdialog


Lyrics
    Add next/prev provide buttons - so that can try others.

FancyTab
    Add option to disable context menu - use this in qt pref
    Context menu should only work when over tab area
    Add option to draw a separator line - use this in qt pref

Add option to specify cover size

Fix usage of threads - ideally writing/reading should be in thread object.

Need better repeat icon.

Support streams - for radio!
   Will probably need to store mapping from URL to name, so that can show this in title.
   How does MPD store this - it doesnt! Could probably save as a playlist with 1 entry?
