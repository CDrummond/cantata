* Playlists
    - Lazy loading of playlist contents - this is not 100%, but is ok if we want genre filtering
    - Add genre filtering
    - If drop a playlist with a stream onto queu, only the stream is added!!!!

* DELETE keyboard short-cut. This needs to work on the focused list.
  Playlists, streams, and playqueue all support deleting.

* Streams - add genre support?

* Library page - show Various Artists at top, with custom icon?

* View style (list/tree) should be generic - ItemView
    - Config option should be 'viewStyle'
    - use stackedWidget as per library page
        - firt page hold treeview and search bar (ItemTreeView)
        - second page holds listview, nav buttons, and search bar (ItemListView)
    - Make style delegate in librarypage generic
    - ListItemDelegate
        - Automatically use for listview (and put in ItemView cpp file)
        - Supply list of actions
        - Add UserRoles to return; icon-size, icon, main-text, sub-text
    ItemView::ItemView(QWidget *p)
    ItemView::setActions(const QList<Action *> &actions)
