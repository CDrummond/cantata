- Playlists
    - Lazy loading of playlist contents - current is not 100%, but is ok if we want genre filtering
    - Add genre filtering

- Streams
    - allow drag'n'drop within categories
    - add genre support?
    - will need to place some items in a menu.
    - Perhaps import/export/edit could go into a 'Tools' menu
    - Handle xspf/spiff playlists
    - Handle more than 1st entry?? Not sure
    - Check that MPD can handle protocols before adding
    - Display list of schemas in 'Info' page

- Library page
    - Have artist icons ?

- Add next/prev provider buttons to lyrics page - so that can try others.

- Need better repeat icon.

- Sidebar
   - Allow to collapse current item

- When displaying search results, should expand items to show matched entry

- Use KMessageWidget to display errors?

- PlayQueue - slow with over 2000 entries, due to sort-filter-proxy??

- icecast?

- libMTP album artist usage.
  - libMTP does not provide an album artist tag.
  - song.cpp has a heck to see if this.albumartist=other.album artist, so that when
    library is frefreshed the file is in the correct place.
  - mtpdevice.cpp will remove albumartist from 'Song' entries copied to it, so that
    these are placed in the correct part of the model.
  - If libMPT is 'fixed' then the above can be rmeoved.
