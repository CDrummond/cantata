...high priority...

Cover Manager
   - Need way to fetch covers
   - Copy amarok code?
   - Have manual button


Covers, have XML file
   <artist name=\"XXXX\">
    <album name=\"XXXX\">~/.kde/.....</album>  <!-- use for custom and/or amarok -->
    <album name=\"XXXX\"></album> <!-- when cover is un set -->
   </artist>


Lyrics page:
   Have a refresh button - this should delete the cache and force a re-fetch.
   HAve a buttons to request next/prev provider?

   [Ref] [provider name \/]  <-- update this combo as we go through them...

Interface settings
   - Initial state, without config, is *bad* (Qt and KDE)
     - if splitterState is empty, need to set sensible default!

Lyrics settings
   Need way to save on 'Apply'

Fix Qt only build
   Proxy - load and save settings
   DirSelect widget
   LineEdit - dont seem to be showing clear button?


...medium priority...

Fix usage of threads - ideally writing/reading should be in thread object.

Need better repeat icon.

Cover fetcher - google, amazon, save to server dir? Read from sever dir? Add to right-click menu "Fetch cover"

Support streams - for radio!
   Will probably need to store mapping from URL to name, so that can show this in title.
   How does MPD store this - it doesnt! Could probably save as a playlist with 1 entry?



...low priority...

When starting, config dialog is shown (because MP not started, etc) then show some text exlplaining this!

Add config of MPD itself -> requires KAuth???
   outputs
   album artist support
