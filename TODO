...high priority...

Initial focus!

Lyrics:
   - Have a refresh button on page - this should delete the cache and force a re-fetch.
   - HAve a buttons to request next/prev provider?
     - save all in memory, but only write last to disk. (But then how to know where it came from???)

   [Ref] [provider name \/]  <-- update this combo as we go through them...

Fix Qt only build
   DirSelect widget



Cover Manager
   - Need way to fetch covers
   - Copy amarok code?
   - Have manual button
   - Support Clementine covers? ~/.config/Clementine/albumcovers/<md5>.jpg


  Covers, have XML file
   <artist name=\"XXXX\">
    <album name=\"XXXX\">~/.kde/.....</album>  <!-- use for custom and/or amarok -->
    <album name=\"XXXX\"></album> <!-- when cover is un set -->
   </artist>


...medium priority...

Fix usage of threads - ideally writing/reading should be in thread object.

Need better repeat icon.

Cover fetcher - google, amazon, save to server dir? Read from sever dir? Add to right-click menu "Fetch cover"

Support streams - for radio!
   Will probably need to store mapping from URL to name, so that can show this in title.
   How does MPD store this - it doesnt! Could probably save as a playlist with 1 entry?



...low priority...

When starting, config dialog is shown (because MP not started, etc) then show some text exlplaining this!

Add config of MPD itself -> requires KAuth???
   outputs
   album artist support
