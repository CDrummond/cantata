- Library
  - Artist icons ?

- Folders
  - Add delete file/folder option??
  - Incremental update of model? Not sure its worth the hassle

- Playlists
  - Lazy loading of playlist contents - current is not 100%, but is ok if we
    want genre filtering
  - Add genre filtering

- Streams
  - add genre support?
    - will need to place some items in a menu.
    - Perhaps import/export/edit could go into a 'Tools' menu
  - Handle xspf/spiff playlists
  - Handle more than 1st entry?? Not sure
  - Check that MPD can handle protocols before adding
  - Display list of schemas in 'Info' page
  - Icecast?

- Lyrics
  - Add next/prev provider buttons - so that can try others.

- Devices
  - libMTP album artist usage.
    - libMTP does not provide an album artist tag.
    - song.cpp has a check to see if this.albumartist=other.album artist, so
      that when library is frefreshed the file is in the correct place.
    - mtpdevice.cpp will remove albumartist from 'Song' entries copied to it,
      so that these are placed in the correct part of the model.
    - If libMPT is 'fixed' then the above can be removed.
  - Make Various 'Artists' fix applicable to all compilation albums?
    - Not sure how this could be done with MTP :-(
    - MTP has no access to other tags, so when converting back, how would I
      know this is a compilation?
  - Allow to drag songs from albums/library to devices, and vice versa.
  - Allow to play UMS files
    - Will need 'IsPlayable' type to be added to ItemView

- PlayQueue
  - Add (optional) simple, non-table-like view?

- General
  - Need better repeat icon.
  - When displaying search results, should expand items to show matched entry

- Sidebar
  - Allow to collapse current item
  - Icon only mode for Large/Small sidebar?
