------------------- Intent ----------------------------------------------------

The following section describes the opinions and intent of the Qxt Foundation
with regards to the licensing and use of the Qxt source code and library. In
the event that the CPL is found to be illegal or invalid, or if any application
or clause of the license is subjected to question or abuse, this section is a
general statement of the desired interpretation.

This section has no legal standing and the statements made here are strictly
subject to the text of the CPL; that is, if this section and the CPL are in
disagreement, the text of the CPL takes precedence. In no way does this
intent grant you any additional rights or impose any additional restrictions.

If you have questions about licensing, contact the maintainers.

Qxt is built and supported by open-source enthusiasts.
- Please respect the open-source background of the contributors. The code is
  provided for everyone's use; you may not restrict the rights of anyone to
  use it.
      - No individual may claim ownership of any part of the code. It belongs
        to the community.
      - You may modify the source code to suit your needs, but these changes
        must be made free. If you distribute a modified form of Qxt, you must
        also distribute the entire source code of the modified form.
      - Digital Rights Management (DRM) puts unfair, unfree restrictions on
        users and developers. It is the opposite of Free Software. We can't
        stop you from using it, but please don't use the Qxt name for software
        restricted by DRM.
- Please respect the time and effort put into the project by the developers.
      - If you find Qxt useful, it would be appreciated if you would include
        text in your application (for instance, in the About dialog) giving
        acknowledgement to Qxt.
      - If you make modifications to the source code, you must not call the
        modified version "Qxt." It's okay to include "Qxt" in the name, but
        anyone who receives the modified version needs to know that it's not
        the same as the version distributed by the Qxt Foundation.
- We want everyone to be able to use Qxt without restrictions.
      - If you distribute Qxt in compiled binary form, please ensure that
        everyone who receives it can get the source code used to create it.
      - You are free to use Qxt in closed-source applications as long as you
        distribute Qxt in an open-source fashion. This does not require you
        to make your entire application open-source.
- The Qxt Foundation is a non-profit, non-political organization.
      - Please don't use the Qxt name in any political or semi-political
        propaganda or publication. We don't like it.
- Qxt is distributed "as-is," with no warranty.
      - If it makes your program crash, your computer blow up, or tiny demons
        fly out of your nose, please don't sue us.
