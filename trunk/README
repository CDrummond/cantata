Introduction
============

Cantata is a GUI front-end for MPD. The code is forked from QtMPC. However,
both the code itself, and the GUI are now *very* different to QtMPC.


Dependencies
============

Cantata requires/uses the following libraries:

1. Qt4
2. KDElibs4 - if Cantata is not built with KDE4 support, then tag editing and
   device support will not be available.
3. QtWebKit - required for the artist/album information page. If QtWebKit is
   not found, the page will not be built.
4. TagLib - required to for the tag edit dialog, and for UMS device support.
5. LibMTP - required to support MTP devices.
6. FFMPEG (libavcodec) - required for ReplayGain detection.
7. SpeexDSP - used by ReplayGain detection code.


Amarok Radio Streams
====================

The script amarok2cantata.sh may be used to covert Amarok Radio plugins
into an XML file suitable to be imported into Cantata. The script is
rather basic and requires the Amarok plugin to list its streams in 'main.js'
with the following syntax:

    Station( "NAME", "URL")

Each station must be on its own line, and must be all in one line.

'script.spec' is used to ascertain the Amarok plugin name, for this the
script will look for the line starting with "Name="
