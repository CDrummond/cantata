* Playlists
    - Lazy loading of playlist contents - this is not 100%, but is ok if we want genre filtering
    - Add genre filtering
    - If drop a playlist with a stream onto queu, only the stream is added!!!!

* Streams
    - add genre support?
    - will need to place some items in a menu.
    - Perhaps import/export/edit could go into a 'Tools' menu
    - should be using "Remove" not "Remove Stream" - to be consistent

* Library page - show Various Artists at top, with custom icon?

* Add a BasicPage class, and use for library, folders, and albums
    - Or add to ItemView ???

* Views - delegate buttons not working???

* UPDATE TRANSLATIONS!!!

----

* Add next/prev provider buttons to lyrics page - so that can try others.

* Need better repeat icon.

* Streams
   - For KDE, need to use getSaveUrl, etc. and use KIO::NetAccess to obatain file.
   - Handle xspf/spiff playlists
   - Handle more than 1st entry?? Not sure
   - Check that MPD can handle protocols before adding
     - Display list of schemas in 'Info' page

* Library browser
   - Have artist icons ?

* Sidebar
   - Allow to collapse current item

* When displaying search results, should expand items to show matched entry
