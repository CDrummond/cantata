- Qt5 port
  - Fix raising of mainwindow via dbus. (Qt5 no longer has QX11Info)

- Windows port
  - CMake scripts not working

- Style
  - Place SpinBox and OnOffButton in style?
  - Overlay scrollbars
    - Currently disabled (pass -DENABLE_OVERLAYSCROLLBARS=ON to cmake to enable)
    - Updating slider value when os-thumb moves is not 100% correct, and not
      consistent with Gtk
    - Does not work for modal dialogs, or combo popups. (Probably due to not
      having parent and modal event loop)
    - Cant seem to re-enable Gtk2 overly scrollbars for actual Gtk dialogs.
  - Using (any!) stylesheet causes pixel error in tabs

- Covers
  - Added code (#ifdef'ed out) to cache scaled covers.
  - Need to save these in "covers-scaled"
    - So that we can delete this cache without affecting covers!
    - Cache page would need new entry for this
  - Need to check responsiveness when loading LOTS of covers
    - i.e. is it really any faster?
  - Need to cater for cover updates.
    - CoverDialog would need to delete items from "covers-scaled"
  - How to detect when covers have been updated externally???

- Streams
  - If radio stream is a playlist, Cantata currently only uses the 1st entry.
    Perhaps Cantata should loop over all entries until we find one that plays?

- Online
  - Podcast support.
  - DAAP servers? (Online or devices? Online as its read-only?)
  - Make list configurable?

- Devices
  - libMTP does not support album artist tag.
  - Port to MTP DBus service when this is released.
  - Allow to drag songs from albums/library to devices, and vice versa.
  - RemoteFsDevices
    - Cantata hangs if smb service is stopped before its un-mounted
  - Re-enable covers in sync dialog?
  - CD-Text?
  - Fix time-remaining calculation.
  - Seek support for AudioCDs
  - Possible issues UDisks2, might not be able to get block device
    (e.g. /dev/sr0)?

- Lyrics
  - Add support for reading via tags in mp4, flac, and ogg files.

- PlayQueue
  - Move code out of MainWindow class.
  - Add copy to device to context menu?
    - Will need to be careful that songs are not from device
    - Also, check that songs are not streams!

- Cue files
  - How to (reliably) determine duration of last track?

- MPD Stream playback
  - URL setting should be in collections page, as each instance will
    have a separate URL!
  - Playback functionality needs to handle URL change when connection changes.

- General
  - Ratings (use KRatingWidget?)
    - Not sure, would need support in cantata-dynamic
  - mpdscribble management
  - mixramp tag calculation
  - mixramp MPD settings
  - Combine 'Page' classes
