- Windows port
  - CMake scripts not working

- Streams
  - If radio stream is a playlist, Cantata currently only uses the 1st entry.
    Perhaps Cantata should loop over all entries until we find one that plays?
  - last.fm streams?

- Devices
  - libMTP does not support album artist tag. Cantata contains some
    work-arounds for this (such as guessing the album-artist tag via the folder
    structure, etc). These should be removed if libMTP ever supports album
    artist.
  - Port to MTP DBus service when this is released.
  - RemoteFsDevices
    - Cantata hangs if smb service is stopped before its un-mounted
  - Re-enable covers in sync dialog?
  - CD-Text?
  - Fix time-remaining calculation in action dialog.
  - Seek support for AudioCDs. Initial implementation works sometimes, but
    other times the song is re-started. Not in build due to being too flaky.
  - Possible issues with UDisks2, might not be able to get block device
    (e.g. /dev/sr0)?
  - Playback from MTP devices.

- Mopdiy
  - Currently does not send valid DB date time (always 0). Users will need to
    force Cantata to update.
  - Does not support 'update' command
  - If the response of a stats call is all 0, then we assume the connection is
    to a Mopdiy server. Therefore, when adding files (from devices) these are
    encoded.

- PlayQueue
  - Move code out of MainWindow class.

- Bugs
  - Handle font (High DPI detection) and palette changes in custom widgets
    (Volume control, time slider, etc)
