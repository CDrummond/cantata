 2. Fix detection of non standard filename covers.
 3. Clear any existing search when 'Locate In Library' is activated.
 4. In tag-editor, only set placeholder text to '(Various)' for fields where
    there are actually some values set.
 5. Add now playing info to MPRIS interface - thanks to Martin Blumenstingl
    for the patch.
 6. Better, less hacky, workaround for QAbstractItemView shift-select bug
    (https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-18009). Thanks to Spitfire
    from qtcentre.org forums for fix.
 7. Add a 'search' action (Ctrl-F) that will move focus to curent tab's search
    field - or to play queue search field (if play queue has focus).
 8. Add 'Raise' support to MPRIS interface.
 9. Added a cantata-specific dbus interface with 'showPage(page, focusSearch)'
    method. So, to raise cantata, show library page, and focus on its search
    field:
        qdbus org.kde.cantata /org/mpris/MediaPlayer2 Raise
        qdbus org.kde.cantata /cantata showPage library true

    'page' can be either; library, albums, folders, playlists, dynamic, streams,
    lyrics, info, serverinfo, or devices. The page will only be shown if it is
    currently enabled.
10. Show song information in playqueue tooltips.
11. Default to 'Alt+<num>' for page shortcuts.
12. Improve MPD connection reliability. When one socket (command or idle) is
    disconnected, only reconnect that one. If a reconnect fails, then
    disconnect both. If we receive an empty reply to a command and socket has
    been closed - then attempt to reconnect and resend command.
13. Request list of URL handlers immediately after connecting.
14. Check if user is a member of 'audio' group at start-up, and warn if they
    are not. If a user is a member of 'audio', then cantata will save covers,
    lyrics, imported songs, etc, as writable by 'audio'
15. Attempt to read defaults from /etc/mpd.conf (This is usually readable by
    'audio' group)
16. If connection fails due to password, then state this in error message.
17. Add extra-large  cover sizes (64pixels library, 160pixels albums).
18. Show full size cover image in tooltip for current track cover preview
    widget.
19. Update copy of ebur128
20. Fix fetching of covers for grouped playlists.
21. For sshfs devices; check ksshaskpass is installed, and check that cantata
    was not launched from the commandline (otherwise ksshaskpass is not
    invoked!)
22. Add option for UMS devices to autoscan, or not, when detected - default is
    set to not autoscan.
23. Fix detection of some UMS devices that are already mounted at startup.
24. Load library view covers in separate thread, as per albums view.
25. Add expandAll (Ctrl +) / collpseAll (Ctrl -) actions to expand/collapse all
    items of currently    focused treeview.
26. Emit dataChanged() for all album header items that match the album
    currently being expanded/collpased in the groupedview.
27. Add a basic 'sync' dialog. Shows two lists; left has songs that are only in
    library, right has songs that are only on device. Each has a 'Copy to'
    action. When songs are copied, the lists are updated to show the remaining
    differences.
28. Fix albums view position when going back from album contents.
29. Add option to draw (15% opacity) tiled cover as background to lyrics page.
30. When clicking on a label, pass focus to buddy widget. If this buddy is a
    checkbox, then also toggle its state.
31. When groping songs into albums, take into account song year. Its possible
    for an artist to release two albums with the same name in different years!
32. Remove 'Single Tracks' cover creation. This is not used in grouped view,
    etc.

0.6.1

    enabled.
 7. Update playlists if modified by another client.
 8. When an album is collapsed/expanded in playqueue, call dataChanged() so that
    title row is redrawn - otherwise, for single-track albums, the view might
    not get refreshed.

10. If fading out to stop, and cantata is closed, then send stop command.
11. Add 'Edit Song Tags' action to playqueue context menu.

25. Use CD icon (without music note) for albums page.
26. Better size calculation of compact view height - should prevent text
    clipping.
27. Use 'plchangesposid' MPD command to get list of playqueue changes - means
    less data needs to be read from MPD per playqueue update.
28. Support 'single' mode.
29. When using large sidebar, attempt to calculate correct min size.
30. Add option to sort albumview by artist/year/album.
31. Add dialog where user can specify artist and title to fetch lyrics - useful
    if automatic fetching fails.
32. Fix crash in albums model when library updated after albums removed.
33. Fix filetype resolver so that we dont attmept to read tags from video files
    (asf/wmv/mp4v) - these seem to crash TagLib.

    is empty!

 8. If compiled for Qt-only, and icon theme is not oxygen, then check to see
    if current icon theme has required icons (devices/media-optical-audio, etc)
    If not, then if oxygen is installed - set icon theme to oxygen.
 9. Allocate more space for tab if required - up to a max of 50% extra. This
    fixes "HTTP Server" config page title under Ubuntu with Qt-only build.
10. Install icon for Qt-only build.

13. Use correct value for transcoder parameter.
14. When saving cache file, if a track is filed under 'single artists' then

16. Add option to sort albums in albums view by either album-artist or
    artist-album.
