Lyrics
    Add next/prev provide buttons - so that can try others.



Fix usage of threads - ideally writing/reading should be in thread object.

Need better repeat icon.

Support streams - for radio!
   Will probably need to store mapping from URL to name, so that can show this in title.
   How does MPD store this - it doesnt! Could probably save as a playlist with 1 entry?

Covers
   Rename Cover to CoverCache
   Disable library updates when cover manager is open
   Cover fetch dialog
       Fetching cover for: <album> by <artist>
       "Configure..." should just have currently selected provider
   --not worth the hassle, so disable cover manager for now.
