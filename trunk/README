Cantata is a GUI front-end for MPD. The code is forked from QtMPC.


Amarok Radio Streams
====================
The script amarok2cantata.sh may be used to covert Amarok Radio plugins
into an XML file suitable to be imported into Cantata. The script is
rather basic and requires the Amarok plugin to list its streams in 'main.js'
with the following syntax:

    Station( "NAME", "URL")

Each station must be on its own line, and must be all in one line.

'script.spec' is used to ascertain the Amarok plugin name, for this the
script will look for the line starting with "Name="
