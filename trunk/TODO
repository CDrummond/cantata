Fix usage of threads - ideally writing/reading should be in thread object.

Need better repeat icon.

Cover fetcher - google, amazon, save to server dir? Read from sever dir? Add to right-click menu "Fetch cover"

   Will probably need to store mapping from URL to name, so that can show this in title.
   How does MPD store this - it doesnt! Could probably save as a playlist with 1 entry?
