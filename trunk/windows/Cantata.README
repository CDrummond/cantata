Introduction
============

Cantata is a GUI client for MPD. Its developed on Linux, using the Qt4
libraries.

This release of Cantata for Windows is built without ffmpeg, mpg123, or
Phonon libraries. Therefore the following features will be missing:

    ReplayGain calculation             - requires ffmpeg and/ormpg123
    Playback of MPD HTTP stream output - requires Phonon


Dynamic Playlists
=================

Cantata uses a perl helper script to facilitate dynamic playlists. This script
is packaged with the cantata source tarball
(see http://code.google.com/p/cantata/downloads/list) This script may be run in
local or server mode. In local mode, Cantata itself starts and stops the script,
and controls the loading of playlists. This mode is currently only available for
Linux builds. In server mode, it is expected  that the script is started and
stopped with mpd on the host Linux machine. Cantata can then be configured to
talk to this script via a simple HTTP interface. In this way, windows builds may
use the dyamic playlist functionality.

More information on how to install this script, etc, is available in the
README file of the Cantata source tarball.
