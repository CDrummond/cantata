- Qt5 port
  - Fix raising of mainwindow via dbus.
    - Qt5 no longer has QX11Info

- Windows port
  - CMake scripts not working

- Style
  - Place SpinBox and OnOffButton in style?
  - Overlay scrollbars
    - Currently disabled (pass -DENABLE_OVERLAYSCROLLBARS=ON to cmake to enable)
    - Updating slider value when os-thumb moves is not 100% correct, and not consistent with Gtk
    - Does not work for modal dialogs, or combo popups. (Probably due to not having parent and modal event loop)
    - Cant seem to re-enable Gtk2 overly scrollbars for actual Gtk dialogs.
  - Using (any!) stylesheet causes pixel error in tabs

- Streams
  - If radio stream is a playlist, Cantata currently only uses the 1st entry

- Devices
  - libMTP does not support album artist tag.
    - Port to MPT DBus service when this is released.
  - Allow to drag songs from albums/library to devices, and vice versa.
  - RemoteFsDevices
    - Cantata hangs if smb service is stopped before its un-mounted
  - Re-enable covers in sync dialog?

- Lyrics
  - Add support for reading via tags in mp4, flac, and ogg files.

- PlayQueue
  - Move code out of MainWindow class
  - Add copy to device to context menu?
    - Will need to be careful that songs are not from device
    - Also, check that songs are not streams!

- Cue files
  - How to determine duration of last track?

- General
  - Ratings (use KRatingWidget?)
    - Not sure, would need support in cantata-dynamic
  - mpdscribble management
  - mixramp tag calculation
  - mixramp MPD setting
  - Combine 'Page' classes
