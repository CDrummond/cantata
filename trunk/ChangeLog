    are 2 or more servers defined, the settings menu will contain a sub menu
    to allow quick access to each server.
15. If an MPD connection has more than 1 output, show an 'Outputs' sub menu
    in the settings menu.
16. Disable volume control if MPD returns a volume of -1 - as it does when the
    mixer is disabled.
17. Read images from mp3 (ID3v2), mp4, flac, and ogg files.
18. Read lyrics from mp3 (ID3v2) files.

3. Fix tag-editor's 'Various Artists' workaround when all tracks is selected.
4. Set minimum font size for info page.
5. Only automatically start playing songs if we are replacing the playqueue, or
   the song is the first song added via the commandline.
6. Fix transcoding with new ffmpeg - thanks to Martin Blumenstingl
   for the patch.
7. Have cantata-dynamic helper script send a dbus message when it starts and
   stops - so that cantata main window can show the current status if the helper
   is started externally.
8. If 'Return'/'Enter' is pressed when play queue has focus, start playing from

    (https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-18009). Thanks to Spitfire
    from qtcentre.org forums for fix.
 7. Add a 'search' action (Ctrl-F) that will move focus to curent tab's search
    field - or to play queue search field (if play queue has focus).
 8. Add 'Raise' support to MPRIS interface.
 9. Added a cantata-specific dbus interface with 'showPage(page, focusSearch)'
    method. So, to raise cantata, show library page, and focus on its search
    field:
        qdbus org.kde.cantata /org/mpris/MediaPlayer2 Raise
        qdbus org.kde.cantata /cantata showPage library true

    'page' can be either; library, albums, folders, playlists, dynamic, streams,
    lyrics, info, serverinfo, or devices. The page will only be shown if it is
    currently enabled.
10. Show song information in playqueue tooltips.
11. Default to 'Alt+<num>' for page shortcuts.
12. Improve MPD connection reliability. When one socket (command or idle) is
    disconnected, only reconnect that one. If a reconnect fails, then
    disconnect both. If we receive an empty reply to a command and socket has
    been closed - then attempt to reconnect and resend command.
13. Request list of URL handlers immediately after connecting.
14. Check if user is a member of 'audio' group at start-up, and warn if they
    are not. If a user is a member of 'audio', then cantata will save covers,
    lyrics, imported songs, etc, as writeable by 'audio'
15. Attempt to read defaults from /etc/mpd.conf (This is usually readable by
    'audio' group)
16. If connection fails due to password, then state this in error message.

18. Show full size cover image in tooltip for current track cover preview
    widget.
19. Update copy of ebur128
20. Fix fetching of covers for grouped playlists.
21. For sshfs devices; check ksshaskpass is installed, and check that cantata
    was not launched from the commandline (otherwise ksshaskpass is not
    invoked!)
22. Add option for UMS devices to autoscan, or not, when detected - default is
    set to not autoscan.
23. Fix detection of some UMS devices that are already mounted at startup.
24. Load library view covers in separate thread, as per albums view.
25. Add expandAll (Ctrl +) / collpseAll (Ctrl -) actions to expand/collapse all
    items of currently    focused treeview.
26. Emit dataChanged() for all album header items that match the album
    currently being expanded/collpased in the groupedview.
27. Add a basic 'sync' dialog. Shows two lists; left has songs that are only in
    library, right has songs that are only on device. Each has a 'Copy to'
    action. When songs are copied, the lists are updated to show the remaining
    differences.
28. Fix albums view position when going back from album contents.
29. Add option to draw (15% opacity) tiled cover as background to lyrics page.
30. When clicking on a label, pass focus to buddy widget. If this buddy is a
    checkbox, then also toggle its state.
31. When grouping songs into albums, take into account song year. Its possible
    for an artist to release two albums with the same name in different years!
32. Remove 'Single Tracks' cover creation. This is not used in grouped view,
    etc.
33. Limit downloaded covers to a max of 600x600 pixels.
34. Dont update 'current song' details when playqueue is updated - the current
    song is updated by other means. As we now use 'plchangesposid' to speed
    updates, we dont always have the full song info when playqueue is updated.
    This fixes a bug where the cover widget sometimes gets reset to empty.
35. When updating a non-MTP device, prompt the user as to whether to perform
    a partial scan (only new songs are scanned), or a full scan (where all songs
    are rescanned).
36. When creating/editing a SSHFS remote device, allow user to use
    KDirRequester to select music folder. (KDirRequester is passed an sftp://
    url to obtin folder listing).
37. When refreshing lyrics, instead of starting at first provider and iterating
    them all again (which will result in the same hit again), start at the next
    provider. This allows all providers to be checked. Thanks to Martin
    Blumenstingl for the patch.
38. Fix copying track from MTP devices.
39. When performing a custom lyrics search, and we have no current song, dont
    attempt to save the file to MPDs music folder (there is no valid filename).
40. When adding items to playqueue, only start to play if playqueue was
    previously empty.
41. When determining indexes to add to 'selectedIndexes' for a collapsed album
    (in grouped style play queue/lists), ensure each index is only added once.
42. Fix loading of songs via commandline if we are set to use HTTP server.

    enabled.
 7. Update playlists if modified by another client.
 8. When an album is collapsed/expanded in playqueue, call dataChanged() so that
    title row is redrawn - otherwise, for single-track albums, the view might

 9. Provide option to *not* store downloaded covers in MPD dir.
10. If fading out to stop, and cantata is closed, then send stop command.
11. Add 'Edit Song Tags' action to playqueue context menu.

    (cover.jpg/png, AlbumArt.jpg/png, folder.jpg/png), then use the first image
    found.
13. Add a 'Locate In Library' action, to locate the selected play queue track
    in the library page.
14. Fix crash when quiting Cantata whilst devices are being scanned.

17. Adjust min and max sizes for sidebar.
18. Add basic lyrics editing.
19. Fix order of items added from playlist to playqueue, when individual items
    of the list were selected.
20. Fix logic of replacing play queue - the clear message is sent in the MPD
    thread just before the add message.
21. Improve albums page responsiveness when loading covers.
22. Better searching - search on all strings, in any order.
23. Automatically expand treeview items when searching.
24. Add custom icons for library and info pages.
25. Use CD icon (without music note) for albums page.
26. Better size calculation of compact view height - should prevent text
    clipping.
27. Use 'plchangesposid' MPD command to get list of playqueue changes - means
    less data needs to be read from MPD per playqueue update.
28. Support 'single' mode.
29. When using large sidebar, attempt to calculate correct min size.
30. Add option to sort albumview by artist/year/album.
31. Add dialog where user can specify artist and title to fetch lyrics - useful
    if automatic fetching fails.
32. Fix crash in albums model when library updated after albums removed.
33. Fix filetype resolver so that we dont attempt to read tags from video files
    (asf/wmv/mp4v) - these seem to crash TagLib.
34. When using MPRISv2 interface, dont attempt to play a song if the playqueue
    is empty!
35. Use SH_ItemView_ActivateItemOnSingleClick to detect single click mode in Qt
    build.

    22px version of each into the application.
 7. Save lyrics and info pages zoom settings.
 8. If compiled for Qt-only, and icon theme is not oxygen, then check to see
    if current icon theme has required icons (devices/media-optical-audio, etc)
